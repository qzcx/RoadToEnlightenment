Testing
==========

Just create a file in the `unit` or `integration` folder, and include it in the corresponding test runner: `unit-tests.html` or `integration-tests.html`.

If there are any global errors, then make sure there are no errors with those files. If you want to, you can uncomment the file in the test drivers `.html` file.

Lastly, don't forget to make sure your `js` file is included in the test drivers `.html` file under `<!-- PROJECT INCLUDES -->`
