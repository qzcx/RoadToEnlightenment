            <p>

                <li>
                    <a href="/login.html">login.html</a> 
                    <p>You can login as one of the default users (listed in the How to Play document) by using their name as the username and then "default" as the password (ie. username=Elizabeth, password=default)</p>
                    <p>You can register a user if you want as well. The fields are highlighted red if they don't meet the minimum length requirements</p>

                    <p>It's here that you can join games. The web-page loads the list of games from the server and lists all games currently being played. We allow you to be in more than one game even though it's not very feasible to play two at one (unless you use two different browsers, or an incognito instance).</p>
                    <p> If there are games listed, you may join any game with an open slot, or rejoin a game you are already in (allowing you to pick a different nation). </p>
                    <p> When you go to join a game, it will bring a screen where you may pick your nation (color). There are 9 nations in all, and you aren't allowed to pick the same nation as another player.</p>
                    <p> If there are no games you like, you may create a new game. To create one, you will need to provide a title, and indicate if the numbers, tiles and ports are going to be randomized. After you create the game, you will be prompted to join it.</p>
